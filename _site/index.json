Successfully make Tancock a potion for strength Tancock drinks the potion and gets his buffs right before the games begins Tancock easily throws the smallest stone His uncle picks up the medium stone and chucks it into a stone Z is standing on. Tancock goes for the heavier stone, lifts it up with a Nat 20 and throws it at the crowd. Lune convinces a scorpion to go sting his uncle, taking Gurglin's cockroach to entice him. His uncle goes to lift a heavier stone, scorpion goes up and stings him for a Nat 20 and poisons him. He stills gets to throw the stone. Tancock goes for a 5000 lbs stone lift, walking up stripping down, booty butt naked. Goes to lift it up, pick it up a little bit and it falls back down to the ground His uncle goes to lift it up next, putting on his helmet. Growing his body to twice his size, but cannot lift up stone, It ends in a tie. People are whispering about Tancocks performance against his uncle We make our way to averniuses call, larger pit play arena for the games. How to play Tula, You have a 30 lbs ball meeting in the middle and try to catch it to start the game with the ball. Goal you’re facing is your goal, protect your own, its one point to score. At the green flag markers with red and blue colors, we are blue team. To earn more points we’ll need to smack the sign to our color, if its facing their goal then its extra points for us. Anything is allowed as long as it isn’t murder. There are traps on the field, near the signs often. You can break the environment and hurt the opponents. Everyone's status is reset each round, max of 6 players. One year the greatest players threw a pillar at a player. We’re playing against his uncles lackies The game begins and they get advantage on getting the ball which they end up getting it. Bro holds onto the ball for dear life, brought down to one health with the ball, Gruglin summons a spiritual spider who goes and gets the ball from the guy. Some other guy grabs the ball from the spider, but with opportunity attack the spider gets a Nat 20 and knocks him out, but his friend comes by and grabs the ball and chucks it to the other guy. They do a pass along between members to score one point on us Game resets 0-1, Tancock wins the ball and moves foward. After flipping all the flags and spiking the ball into the ball scoring us 6 points, we are now 6-1. Tancock’s Uncle hops in the ring to join the game due to anger. Tancock Uncle's team eats a fruit that heals all their injuries. Game begins, and Tancock grabs the ball, after Gruglin hits his hand with it twice, also spider flipped the sign to our side. Tancock's Uncle uses a lengendary action to try to push Tancock against the wall. Sludge uses a eldritch blast on two of the signs to flipping them to our side. Z when wuadadadadadaada on Tancock's Uncle and did some good hearty damage to him. Tancock's Uncle tried to rip the ball out of Tancock's hands but it wouldn't budge from Tancock's hands, he screams out in anger and grows to 15 feet call out of pure haterade. He then goes and slams his fist into Tancock's face and hits him for 21 damage. Goes for a second hit and completely biffs it. Lune's owl zooms past everyone, grabbing the ball from Tancock and speeds to the goal, scoring us the winning goal 8-1 Rena is Tancock's Mom We all head to the edge of town, to celebrate and dine before the battle tommorrow. We are within the large snakes body, with lots of fires, cooking and celebrating going on. Everyone goes out playing games and partying, but then we get back together and walk off with Tancock, his mom, and sister. Tancock's mom brings up old memories, and Tancock tries to remember it, but can barely do so. She brings up another memory, a trinket that Tancock made for his mother. It was a small pocket watch with his fathers symbol carved in it. Inside the pocket watch, its inscribed with \"I love you mom\". Tancock was 12 when it happened, his father was ambushed by his Uncle and others stuck in their ways, breaking his workshop and dragging him out to the street. He never fought back, after getting beat up multiple times, he only started to fight back once he laid a finger on his wife. Tancock can remember his father being beaten, bloody and weak, his Uncle backhanding his mom, with his father then breaking out into a rage, using his mechanical prowess to fight back into his brother. His brother won the fight, breaking his mechanical arms, with Tancock's father pleading for peace, his brother breaks his argument by crushing in his skull. Tancock goes to grab whats left of his father, trying to hurt his Uncle, takes a chunk out of him with the tech. His Uncle slaps him back into a ditch, scolds him before caving in his skull and stomping onto his head. Tancock's vision ends. His mother explains that after this, he through Tancock's body in the river, and he was presumed dead, his memory is fully restored. Everyone goes to comfort Tancock. We will be fighting in the thunderdome tomorrow, It will be an all out warfare. There is no help from others, just ourselves. Gruglin get a \"maybe\" friendly scorpion. Tancock tries to think about the pocket watch, trying to understand how he could of possibly made it. Lune, sneaks in by a bug and listens in with Tancock Uncle's group to try and gain insights about their plan. There is a orc named Zander, who has some familiarity with magic who doen't seem to be along with Tancock's Uncle. Eventually she manages to get his attention and trys to get him to not call us out on using magic, IF Tancock accepts it. He says that he wouldn't tell them if we don't make it obvious."

Gruglin and Sludge come back and also goes to give Tancock buffs. We all get lead to the battle arena by guards, and are split from Tancock where he heads to the arena, after we all said our goodbyes. There is also some sports betting going on, some of us bet on Tancock winning and a lot of citizens are betting on Tancock's Uncle. Gruglin bets 4 Gold, 4 Silver, 9 Bronze on Bet * Tancock gets given a long sword from Leonis of Austis, it needs to be attunded to The battle begins, and Tancock's uncle hits Tancock hard, Tancock attacks back with equal force, and an addtionally attack as well on his calf. Tancock gets hit again, and cowers under his shield, secrently prepping his jump boots. As his uncle goes into attack him, Tancock jumps with crazy speed, tearing his helmet off his head with skin and bones. The helmet bounces off his head against the edge of the arena. Tancock jumps over to it and puts on the helmet, and see's that his Uncle has a pulsing thing in his head tries to charge at him which his head almost completely scalped His uncle goes and grabs Tancocks head and slams his head into a rock on the stadium. Then takes his hand made of stone and beats in has face, breaking his nose, and holds his body in his hands. Tancock hears a voice in the helmet, its his dad and gives his advice on how to get out of this situation. Sybil finds one half of the shield's power source and causes the shield to start flickering. His uncle, slams Tancock into the wall, and throws him into the dome then he falls into the ground. Then stands over him and slamming his head with his foot. His uncle, calls on backup to deal with us, bringing all of Munch Bunch into battle. Gruglin tries to jump in between the flickering, gets caught in it for a second but gets thrown out with his arm going numb for awhile. Sludge turns to an orc and absolutely demolishes them. Sybil and Lune manage to get through the shield, and uncle tries to hit Sybil but she dodges his attack twice, he then goes in for a legendary attack and hits in his fist into her head. Sybil casts hellish rebuke on Tancock's uncle, turning his arm into flames. Tancock goes in for the kill on his uncle, getting right infront of him, looking up at him, slamming his sword through his head, using his jump boots to jump right through him yelling out \"Suffer as I have!\". Even though he's dead, Tancock goes to cave in his head, like he did all those years ago. Tancock, notices a tooth in his uncles body that begins to reform his body, while he's not there any longer, he's a host to a parasite. The barrier drops Sludge drops into the arena, and heads towards his uncle. Z, still in the stands, goes for one of the Orcs and slices him into small bits, then goes to attack another Orc killing him as well. One of the Orcs goes to attack Gruglin, bringing him close to death, but Sybil after attacking Tancock's uncle, she heals Gruglin. Lune, with pure rage, then summons 8 raptors to surround and attack Tancock's uncle that absoltuely maw at him barely leaving him standing. His uncle, enraged at Lune, slams into him and downs him. Then he goes to hit Sybil but Tancok swings in deflecting his attack. The monster then turns to Gruglin and says, \"Father....Help!!!\" Tancock goes in to finally end this battle, saying \"For the Munch Bunch\"!, drops his sheild and pulls out his sword like a samarui, slicing him up, slowly up his body, mincing him down. Tancock crushes the tooth, it turns into a red paste of blood and tongues. The crowd errupts into cheers for Tancock, winning the battle. Lune goes and grabs whats left of the gold. Tancock feels relief on the tribe, and puts his sword to rest, as if its a new chapter. Party breaks out with every drinking and partying. Sybil is taking a breather to herself but still with others Gruglin is stand offish and doesn't eat or drink. Tancock gives a speech saying that he's going to stay with the Stonefage tribe and lead them. Table grows silent. They lift their glass, and say \"Tancock of the West\". Later in the night, Tancock puts the helmet back on, hearing the voice of his father again, he says that he'll lead the tribe well, and welcome to your own personal helmet. His father offers for him to continue as a Paladin or switch to something more magic based. (Father was a artificer). He chooses to follow in his fathers path, and the helmet puts his head back together. in his brain His father takes him under is wing, showing him around his workshop, teaching him skills and magic spells. Tancock begins to fall back into older habits, his father, at the end of it all says, \"Tantulus, I know that I'm probably not around, and if I was you wouldn't of heard this part of the message, I love you son and I'm proud of you, whatever choices you make, the amazing ones that impact the world forever, whether you bring our tribe into a new age, you'll forever leave an impact in those you meet. I have one request, if I am gone, there might be a way to bring me back.\" Sludge, his magic felt off, almost wrong, it was ripping itself apart from the atoms. He feels this aching in his being. His mind dragon talks to him saying \"Sludge, come home...We need...to face him together...I think...the wizard...is looking for you...looking for me.\" He sees those familiar blue eyes from the darkness, it's an renactment of the day Sludge was born. Seeing the staff of creation, stones crack the crystals and mix with the blood of the dragons. The wizard cries out in anger, as he'd lost everything he'd worked for. Sludge feels that pull coming his way, being stuck in the moment with the dragon. \"Find the cave...help me...I will restore our power...you made a deal...honor it.\" Then bringing Sludge back into the moment. Gruglin feels another piece click into his mind. He remembers that longer than he'd been alive he'd had a memory in his brain. being held in a dwarfs arms, moms face fadded out, but knowing its her. I remember the face of a large gnomish man, a deeper gnome that had the same teeth that dragon had. He questions how long ago that was. Urge to look at the poster of the long dead king, geting a pain of a life that could've been. He feels that, if he could find that tooth, maybe it'd help me. Lune, goes to sit on a large ancient snake creature structure, picking out constalations in the sky, knowing the stories of each one. Hearing something as they look into that abyss. As he sits looking at the sky, he sees a far away burning meteor burling towards the earth. He tries to find out how far it is, measuring it out, it could arrive within just a little bit more than 30 days. He relizes that it's going to hit near Rand. Lune pulls out the metor, in a muffled voice it says something, but whipsers circle around the rock. It talks to Lune speaking in his mind saying \"I see you...I am Leeon...and I am coming...I am a emmisary...and I will bring you back\" I regain a santiy point & Level Up Gruglin is lost again, again like when he lost Leif. Gruglin wants to tell Tancock that, he's proud of how far he's come, and he's happy that he's able to regain his memories. Gruglin bets 4 Gold, 4 Silver, 9 Bronze on Bet *"
