<ul>
<li>Everyone wakes up for the day, me and Sludge are absolutely COMPING down on some breakfast.</li>
<li>Sybil, Z, and Lune are buffing Tancock before the big fight.</li>
<li>Gruglin and Sludge come back and also goes to give Tancock buffs.</li>
<li>We all get lead to the battle arena by guards, and are split from Tancock where he heads to the arena, after we all said our goodbyes.</li>
<li>There is also some sports betting going on, some of us bet on Tancock winning and a lot of citizens are betting on Tancock's Uncle.</li>
<li>Gruglin bets 4 Gold, 4 Silver, 9 Bronze on Bet</li>
<li>Tancock gets given a long sword from Leonis of Austis, it needs to be attunded to</li>
<li>The battle begins, and Tancock's uncle hits Tancock hard, Tancock attacks back with equal force, and an addtionally attack as well on his calf.</li>
<li>Tancock gets hit again, and cowers under his shield, secrently prepping his jump boots.</li>
<li>As his uncle goes into attack him, Tancock jumps with crazy speed, tearing his helmet off his head with skin and bones. The helmet bounces off his head against the edge of the arena.</li>
<li>Tancock jumps over to it and puts on the helmet, and see's that his Uncle has a pulsing thing in his head tries to charge at him which his head almost completely scalped</li>
<li>His uncle goes and grabs Tancocks head and slams his head into a rock on the stadium.</li>
<li>Then takes his hand made of stone and beats in has face, breaking his nose, and holds his body in his hands.</li>
<li>Tancock hears a voice in the helmet, its his dad and gives his advice on how to get out of this situation.</li>
<li>Sybil finds one half of the shield's power source and causes the shield to start flickering.</li>
<li>His uncle, slams Tancock into the wall, and throws him into the dome then he falls into the ground. Then stands over him and slamming his head with his foot.</li>
<li>His uncle, calls on backup to deal with us, bringing all of Munch Bunch into battle.</li>
<li>Gruglin tries to jump in between the flickering, gets caught in it for a second but gets thrown out with his arm going numb for awhile.</li>
<li></li>

Maul = 1d8 + 4 + 2</p>
<p>Right hand is numb, but I have two weapon fighting, so I'm proficient with two weapons, so it doesn't matter</p>
