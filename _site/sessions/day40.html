<ul>
<li>Awake in the tent</li>
<li>First game today is the show of the fang, today Tancock with try to lift the large boulder to show strength</li>
<li>We decide to look for potion sellers to make some kind of enhancing potion to help Tancock win this competition alongside our magical spells</li>
<li>Hendrix knew Tancocks father, is trying to show us how to make a potion to help him.</li>
<li>Successfully make Tancock a potion for strength</li>
<li>Tancock drinks the potion and gets his buffs right before the games begins</li>
<li>Tancock easily throws the smallest stone</li>
<li>His uncle picks up the medium stone and chucks it into a stone Z is standing on.</li>
<li>Tancock goes for the heavier stone, lifts it up with a Nat 20 and throws it at the crowd.</li>
<li>Lune convinces a scorpion to go sting his uncle, taking Gurglin's cockroach to entice him.</li>
<li>His uncle goes to lift a heavier stone, scorpion goes up and stings him for a Nat 20 and poisons him. He stills gets to throw the stone.</li>
<li>Tancock goes for a 5000 lbs stone lift, walking up stripping down, booty butt naked. Goes to lift it up, pick it up a little bit and it falls back down to the ground</li>
<li>His uncle goes to lift it up next, putting on his helmet. Growing his body to twice his size, but cannot lift up stone, It ends in a tie.</li>
<li>People are whispering about Tancocks performance against his uncle</li>
<li>We make our way to averniuses call, larger pit play arena for the games.</li>
<li>How to play Tula, You have a 30 lbs ball meeting in the middle and try to catch it to start the game with the ball. Goal you’re facing is your goal, protect your own, its one point to score. At the green flag markers with red and blue colors, we are blue team. To earn more points we’ll need to smack the sign to our color, if its facing their goal then its extra points for us. Anything is allowed as long as it isn’t murder. There are traps on the field, near the signs often. You can break the environment and hurt the opponents. Everyone's status is reset each round, max of 6 players.</li>
<li>One year the greatest players threw a pillar at a player.</li>
<li>We’re playing against his uncles lackies</li>
<li>The game begins and they get advantage on getting the ball which they end up getting it.</li>
<li>Bro holds onto the ball for dear life, brought down to one health with the ball, Gruglin summons a spiritual spider who goes and gets the ball from the guy.</li>
<li>Some other guy grabs the ball from the spider, but with opportunity attack the spider gets a Nat 20 and knocks him out, but his friend comes by and grabs the ball and chucks it to the other guy.</li>
<li>They do a pass along between members to score one point on us</li>
<li>Game resets 0-1, Tancock wins the ball and moves foward. After flipping all the flags and spiking the ball into the ball scoring us 6 points, we are now 6-1.</li>
<li>Tancock’s Uncle hops in the ring to join the game due to anger.</li>
<li>Tancock Uncle's team eats a fruit that heals all their injuries.</li>
<li>Game begins, and Tancock grabs the ball, after Gruglin hits his hand with it twice, also spider flipped the sign to our side.</li>
<li>Tancock's Uncle uses a lengendary action to try to push Tancock against the wall.</li>
<li>Sludge uses a eldritch blast on two of the signs to flipping them to our side.</li>
<li>Z when wuadadadadadaada on Tancock's Uncle and did some good hearty damage to him.</li>
<li>Tancock's Uncle tried to rip the ball out of Tancock's hands but it wouldn't budge from Tancock's hands, he screams out in anger and grows to 15 feet call out of pure haterade. He then goes and slams his fist into Tancock's face and hits him for 21 damage. Goes for a second hit and completely biffs it.</li>
<li>Lune's owl zooms past everyone, grabbing the ball from Tancock and speeds to the goal, scoring us the winning goal 8-1</li>
<li>Rena is Tancock's Mom</li>
<li>We all head to the edge of town, to celebrate and dine before the battle tommorrow. We are within the large snakes body, with lots of fires, cooking and celebrating going on.</li>
<li>Everyone goes out playing games and partying, but then we get back together and walk off with Tancock, his mom, and sister.</li>
<li>Tancock's mom brings up old memories, and Tancock tries to remember it, but can barely do so. She brings up another memory, a trinket that Tancock made for his mother. It was a small pocket watch with his fathers symbol carved in it. Inside the pocket watch, its inscribed with &quot;I love you mom&quot;.</li>
<li>Tancock was 12 when it happened, his father was ambushed by his Uncle and others stuck in their ways, breaking his workshop and dragging him out to the street. He never fought back, after getting beat up multiple times, he only started to fight back once he laid a finger on his wife.</li>
<li>Tancock can remember his father being beaten, bloody and weak, his Uncle backhanding his mom, with his father then breaking out into a rage, using his mechanical prowess to fight back into his brother. His brother won the fight, breaking his mechanical arms, with Tancock's father pleading for peace, his brother breaks his argument by crushing in his skull. Tancock goes to grab whats left of his father, trying to hurt his Uncle, takes a chunk out of him with the tech.</li>
<li>His Uncle slaps him back into a ditch, scolds him before caving in his skull and stomping onto his head. Tancock's vision ends. His mother explains that after this, he through Tancock's body in the river, and he was presumed dead, his memory is fully restored.</li>
<li>Everyone goes to comfort Tancock.</li>
<li>We will be fighting in the thunderdome tomorrow, It will be an all out warfare. There is no help from others, just ourselves.</li>
<li>Gruglin get a &quot;maybe&quot; friendly scorpion.</li>
<li>Tancock tries to think about the pocket watch, trying to understand how he could of possibly made it.</li>
<li>Lune, sneaks in by a bug and listens in with Tancock Uncle's group to try and gain insights about their plan. There is a orc named Zander, who has some familiarity with magic who doen't seem to be along with Tancock's Uncle. Eventually she manages to get his attention and trys to get him to not call us out on using magic, IF Tancock accepts it. He says that he wouldn't tell them if we don't make it obvious.</li>
