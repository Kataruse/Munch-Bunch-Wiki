- People are whispering about Tancocks performance against his uncle

- How to play Tula, You have a 30 lbs ball meeting in the middle and try to catch it to start the game with the ball. Goal you’re facing is your goal, protect your own, its one point to score. At the green flag markers with red and blue colors, we are blue team. To earn more points we’ll need to smack the sign to our color, if its facing their goal then its extra points for us. Anything is allowed as long as it isn’t murder. There are traps on the field, near the signs often. You can break the environment and hurt the opponents. Everyone's status is reset each round, max of 6 players.
- One year the greatest players threw a pillar at a player.
- We’re playing against his uncles lackies
- The game begins and they get advantage on getting the ball which they end up getting it.
- Bro holds onto the ball for dear life, brought down to one health with the ball, Gruglin summons a spiritual spider who goes and gets the ball from the guy.
- Some other guy grabs the ball from the spider, but with opportunity attack the spider gets a Nat 20 and knocks him out, but his friend comes by and grabs the ball and chucks it to the other guy.
- They do a pass along between members to score one point on us
- Game resets 0-1, Tancock wins the ball and moves foward. After flipping all the flags and spiking the ball into the ball scoring us 6 points, we are now 6-1.
- Tancock’s Uncle hops in the ring to join the game due to anger.
