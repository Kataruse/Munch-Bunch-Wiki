# Vinny and The Threats (V.S.) Munch Bunch (Part-1)

- Season 3 Episode 3 of Heroes v.s. Heroes.
- We're all teleported right out of where were just located.
- We all see a large minotaur with large stones and heads haning from its belt on a screen. It's a god of war from Coptia.
- Bane, a silph emperor, the god of chaos and bringer of death from the other universe. Dismembered parts of various types of people all over his body.
- We're then all given additional information about the other team, and forced to fight to the death.
- Mag was downed, they jumped over to Z and tried to attack him but he missed and Z hit him back to back bringing him down. Totunga came back and brought him back to stable.
- Totunga summoned a bunch of velocaraptors that were trying to surround Z, but before they could attack, Tancock came in and attacked him and shoved him out of the water. Then Sybil used a Lv.3 Guiding Bolt and CRITITALLY HIT him with 45 damage. Calmaria casts healing ward on Totunga to bring them back up from being down.
- Eleanora is downed by Tancock after he jumped right by her and slashed down on her.
- Lolo tries to escape to get away, but Tancock swings at them, bringing them down.
- Mag, comes over and RAGES at Tancock, and he takes him down, but, Tancock being an Orc, comes back up in rough shape.
- Tancock, upset at Mag, goes for a swing at him and brings Mag down.

- Both Gruglin and Totunga both are left lying and fail their death saving throws, killing them.
- Soon later, Lune joined them.
