# Thursday Day 47

- Everyone wakes up, Z, George, and Sludge go to stay at the cart while Gruglin, Sybil, and Lune go back to bury the kid.
- George looks at our items in the cart and finds Tancock's Trident, it's glowing.
- George goes over to Z and asks Z why the trident is glowing when he's around, Z says that he doesn't know much about it.
- We decide to bury the kid closer to the forest within earshot of his house, we dig not too big of a hole and leave him inside.
- Lune wraps him in his bedding while Sybil makes a headstone for him.
- Gruglin leaves him his car that he fixed up for him since he has his train, Sybil leaves him a worm since he was playing with bugs, Lune keeps casting druid craft.
- The group at the cart comes by to pay respect to the kid, Z leaves his dice set, George plants some hemp seeds.
- Lune and Sybil go back to try and scrape up the poison from the broken salve jar and manage to scrape up enough of it to use it twice.
- Afterward we head back to the cart and head back to Wyra
