# Wednesday Day 24

- Sybil’s glove is ready!
- See wooden statues of Wyra
- Headed out of Wyra
- Lee bought a “magic” kazoo
- Sludge bought a hat that changes every single day
- Gruglin has a nightmare about murdering Leif being excited to do so, has a vision of his first moments in life seeing his mother for the first time and a man saying that the “Queen Bee’s Bee Keepers will keep your son safe”, see a dark shadow of a person in the corner reach out a scared hand towards him
