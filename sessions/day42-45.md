# Saturday-Tuesday Days 42-45

-  In the morning, we're all getting ready to leave Tancock and the stonefang tribe behind
- Gruglin studies the paper Percius gave him of the King of Coptia, who looks so familiar but I know it's not me. He is lost again, again like when he lost Leif.
- Sludge is also in their head, thinking about last nights events.
- We finish packing up our things onto the turtle, our driver the "Bugman" clitters and clacks for everyone to board.
-  We all say bye to Tancock, Lune sneakily puts some magic stones in his pocket before we leave. The scorpion climbs up out of Tancocks pocket and waves bye to us.
-  We head through the laughing savanna, while one the raft, Sybil checks out a gift that one of Luke's people gave her, it turned into a mobile alchemy kit that is 100% stable!
-  3 days are spent traveling
-  Night of Tuesday there was a monkey up on our cart eating and munching on our stuff.
