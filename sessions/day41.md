- Later in the night, Tancock puts the helmet back on, hearing the voice of his father again, he says that he'll lead the tribe well, and welcome to your own personal helmet. His father offers for him to continue as a Paladin or switch to something more magic based. (Father was a artificer). He chooses to follow in his fathers path, and the helmet puts his head back together. in his brain His father takes him under is wing, showing him around his workshop, teaching him skills and magic spells. Tancock begins to fall back into older habits, his father, at the end of it all says, "Tantulus, I know that I'm probably not around, and if I was you wouldn't of heard this part of the message, I love you son and I'm proud of you, whatever choices you make, the amazing ones that impact the world forever, whether you bring our tribe into a new age, you'll forever leave an impact in those you meet. I have one request, if I am gone, there might be a way to bring me back."
- Sludge, his magic felt off, almost wrong, it was ripping itself apart from the atoms. He feels this aching in his being. His mind dragon talks to him saying "Sludge, come home...We need...to face him together...I think...the wizard...is looking for you...looking for me."
- He sees those familiar blue eyes from the darkness, it's an renactment of the day Sludge was born. Seeing the staff of creation, stones crack the crystals and mix with the blood of the dragons. The wizard cries out in anger, as he'd lost everything he'd worked for. Sludge feels that pull coming his way, being stuck in the moment with the dragon.
- "Find the cave...help me...I will restore our power...you made a deal...honor it." Then bringing Sludge back into the moment.
- Gruglin feels another piece click into his mind. He remembers that longer than he'd been alive he'd had a memory in his brain. being held in a dwarfs arms, moms face fadded out, but knowing its her. I remember the face of a large gnomish man, a deeper gnome that had the same teeth that dragon had. He questions how long ago that was. Urge to look at the poster of the long dead king, geting a pain of a life that could've been. He feels that, if he could find that tooth, maybe it'd help me.
- Lune, goes to sit on a large ancient snake creature structure, picking out constalations in the sky, knowing the stories of each one. Hearing something as they look into that abyss. As he sits looking at the sky, he sees a far away burning meteor burling towards the earth. He tries to find out how far it is, measuring it out, it could arrive within just a little bit more than 30 days. He relizes that it's going to hit near Rand. Lune pulls out the metor, in a muffled voice it says something, but whipsers circle around the rock.
- It talks to Lune speaking in his mind saying "I see you...I am Leeon...and I am coming...I am a emmisary...and I will bring you back"
