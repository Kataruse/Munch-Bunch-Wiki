# Wednesday Day 52

- We make it Wyra and see the dome of the school that Lune and Sybil attended, large towers within the sky, stores, and museums.
- Lune heads straight to their parents house while everyone else goes shopping. Flying home they see their family's house and greeted by the familiar scent of rice and curry like spices. His dad is cooking and the creature they took from the caves is awaiting for them.
- Lune's dad tells Lune that something is long with the tree, Mom can't talk about it to dad since he left being in the circle. Lola's in the guest room, but the tree is dying and Wyra's in danger. A sickness has overcome it. Silver sap is coming from the tree and it's loosing altitude.
- The kid pulls Sludge aside and asks him about his past, he says what has *ydrissel* told you about yourself? 
- Sludge asks why, and he responses because I'm your father.

EVERYONE IS SHOPPING
