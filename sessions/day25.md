# Thursday Day 25

- Head out from the tavern
- End up underneath the island
- See lots of clay huts
- Tancock and Lee have a successful night watch
- So does Sybil and Gruglin but Gruglin befriends a crow and let it rest in his hair
- Lune and Sludge have last watch and find out the crow is a familiar but it flies away
