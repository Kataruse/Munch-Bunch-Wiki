# Wednesday Day 31

- Travel
- Make it to Meteora
- Gruglin stays with Perseus everyone heads to the fairy smithy
- Smithy hates dwarfs
- Half a year since Tancocks last campaign
- Gruglin and Perseus talk
- He says he wants to find out what's going on in the kingdom we're going to, and he thinks Gruglin have a connection to whatever is going on there.
- He showed Gruglin a propaganda flyer with a man who looks very similar to me, but the flyer is over 100 years old.
- He wants me to help him make sure the party doesn't interfere and turn on him so he can find out the truth and so can Gruglin
